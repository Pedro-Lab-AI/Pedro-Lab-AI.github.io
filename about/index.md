## ***Pedro Pinheiro-Chagas, PhD***

I am a [***Neuroscience Assistant Professor***](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/pedro.pinheirochagas#:~:text=He%20studies%20the%20neural%20architecture,and%20how%20we%20can%20help.) at the [***University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center***](https://memory.ucsf.edu/), Department of Neurology. I study the neural architecture and dynamics of ***human intelligence***, with a focus on ***cognitive symbolic systems*** such as mathematics and language. My research program aims to understand how these systems develop and decline and how we can help.

I apply ***machine learning*** and computational modelling to electrophysiological recordings (intracranial EEG, MEG), neuroimaging (fMRI), continuous behavioral measures (trajectory-tracking) and neuropsychology to study the processing stages and representational codes underlying cognitive operations. Complementarily, I use intracranial electrical stimulation to modulate brain activity and behavior.

Recently, I have been advancing the development of ***sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI)-driven models*** designed to ***predict and characterize neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions***, ultimately aiding in their diagnosis.
